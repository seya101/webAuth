# WebAuth

A secure and efficient web app that uses Firebase's authentication service and Vite's build tool to provide a fast and responsive user experience.

Firebase provides a range of authentication options, including email and password, social media sign-ins, and multi-factor authentication. It also offers real-time database functionality to store user data securely.

Vite, on the other hand, is a build tool that enables developers to build and bundle their web app quickly and efficiently. It includes features like hot module replacement, which allows changes to be updated in real-time without the need for a full page reload.

By using these tools together, developers can create a web authentication application that is both highly secure and performs well. The app can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of the business or organization, and updates can be deployed quickly and efficiently.
